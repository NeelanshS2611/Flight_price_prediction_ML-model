# Flight_price_prediction_ML-model
End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Flight Price Prediction with AWS SageMaker
This project is a practical implementation of a machine learning workflow using AWS SageMaker. The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of building, deploying, and managing a machine learning model on the cloud, specifically for predicting flight prices.

ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights
End-to-End ML Workflow: Covers everything from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model training, and cloud deployment.
AWS SageMaker Integration: Utilizes SageMaker for scalable model training and deployment, leveraging AWS services like S3, EC2, and IAM.
Web Application Deployment: Includes a user-friendly web app built with Streamlit for predicting flight prices, deployed on the cloud.
ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Cloud Services: AWS SageMaker, S3, EC2
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Streamlit)
Visualization: Custom EDA modules for statistical insights and plots
Deployment: Streamlit for web application hosting
